                <p style="font-size:20px">Indian culture and traditions are something which has now become renowned all across the world. 
                    We all refer to customs and traditions of India as something very diverse and unique. But seldom 
                    do we give a thought to why things are done in certain specific ways. Indian culture is full of 
                    several unique customs and traditions, which outsiders might find intriguing. Most of these 
                    originate from the Ancient Indian scriptures and texts, which have dictated the way of life in 
                    India for thousands of years.</p>

                <p style="font-size:20px">The Namaste is one of the most popular Indian customs and isn't just restricted to the Indian 
                    territory anymore. You have Barack Obama, who has been seen doing it on various occasions, or 
                    you had Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, greeting everyone with a namaste at the Times 
                    Square in New York on the first International Yoga Day.</p>

                <p style="font-size:20px">India also sees a large number of festivals, mainly because of the 
                    prevalence of diverse religions and groups. The Muslims celebrate Eid, the Christians have 
                    Christmas and good Friday, the Sikhs have Baisakhi (harvesting of crop), and the birthdays of 
                    their Gurus and the Hindus have Diwali, Holi, Makar Sakranti, the Jains have Mahavir Jayanti, 
                    the Buddhists celebrate the Buddha's birthday on Buddha Poornima, and quite honestly, the 
                    number is endless. All of these translate to holidays in our book, of course.</p>

                <p style="font-size:20px">Also, in India, there exists the concept of a joint family, wherein the 
                    entire family (parents, wife, children and in some cases, relatives) all live together. This 
                    is mostly because of the cohesive nature of the Indian society, and also reportedly helps in 
                    handling pressure and stress.</p>

                <p style="font-size:20px">Symbols or nature worship, system of religion based on the veneration of natural phenomena—for example, 
                    celestial objects such as the sun and moon and terrestrial objects such as water and fire.In 
                    the history of religions and cultures, nature worship as a definite and complex system of 
                    belief or as a predominant form of religion has not been well documented. Among the indigenous 
                    peoples of many countries, the concept of nature as a totality is unknown; only individual 
                    natural phenomena—e.g., stars, rain, and animals—are comprehended as natural objects or forces 
                    that influence them and are thus in some way worthy of being venerated or placated. Nature as an 
                    entity in itself, in contrast with human society and culture or even with God, is a philosophical 
                    or poetic conception that has been developed among advanced civilizations. This concept of nature 
                    worship, therefore, is limited primarily to scholars involved in or influenced by the modern 
                    (especially Western) study of religion.</p>

                <p style="font-size:20px">Most temples are located along magnetic wave lines of the Earth, which 
                    help in maximising the available positive energy. The copper plate (called Garbhagriha or 
                    Moolasthan) buried under the main idol absorbs and resonates this energy to its surroundings. 
                    Going to the temple often helps in having a positive mind and garnering positive energies, 
                    which in turn lead to healthier functioning.It is also a practice to take off footwear before 
                    entering places of worship because they would bring in the dirt to an otherwise cleansed and 
                    sanctified environment.</p>

                <p style="font-size:20px">In India, the saying <span style="color: #0033cc">'Atithi Devo Bhavah' is also integral. It means 
                        'the guest is equivalent to god'</span>. It is a Sanskrit verse taken from the Hindu scriptures, 
                    which later became a part of the Code of conduct for Indian society since the guest has 
                    always been of supreme importance in the Culture of India.</p>

                <p style="font-size:20px">Indian women are often seen sporting 'saris'. The sari is a single 
                    cloth and needs no stitching; it is easy to make and comfortable to wear, and also adheres to
                    religious etiquette. It initially started as a Hindu tradition but has very elegantly spread 
                    across all religions. The same applies to the more functional 'Kurta-Pyjama', and the formal 
                    wear of 'Sherwani' for Indian men of all faiths.</p>

                <p style="font-size:20px">ndia is a land of 'unity in diversity', and our dances are no different.
                    Different forms of dance(classified as folk or classical) find origin from different parts of 
                    the country, and they are a way of representation of the particular culture from which they 
                    originate. Eight classical dances, which are classified as Indian classical dances and find a 
                    mention in the Hindu Sanskrit text 'Natyashashtra', (a text of performing arts) are:</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px">Folk dances mainly trace their importance to the rural areas, where 
                performances depict the day to day life of rural inhabitants. The process for a suitable match
                is one long and tiring effort, which begins with matching some criteria like the horoscope, 
                religion, caste, professional stature, physical appearance and culture. It is made sure that 
                majority of the requirements are a 'match made in heaven' (even if it has to be tailor-made). 
                After all the checkboxes are ticked, the elders of the family meet for a face to face 
                interaction. Once the talks are successful, preparations for the wedding begin in full swing.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px">Indian food and cuisine not only form an integral part of the culture of
                India but are also one of the critical factors of India's popularity worldwide. The style of 
                cooking varies from region to region, though unanimously, Indian food has a significant 
                reputation for its extensive use of spices and herbs. Just like dances, religious practices, 
                language and clothes, you will also find a wide variety of food throughout the country. Almost 
                every region is known for a signature dish or ingredient.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px">India is socially, culturally, and linguistically very diverse. Hindi 
                and English are widely spoken and recognised for official purposes. Other than than, there are
                22 scheduled languages recognised by the constitution of India. However, more than 400 
                languages and dialects in India are still not known. Dialects change even with a few 
                kilometres of travel in the state. Over the years, about 190 languages have become endangered 
                due to very few surviving speakers.<br>
                There exist thousands of traditions and culture in India, and quite a few of them would leave 
                outsiders rather curious. But the crux of Indian society and culture has always been to be well
                mannered, polite, respect others, and progress together.</p>
